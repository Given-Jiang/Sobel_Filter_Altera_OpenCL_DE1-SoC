- Version Identifier
- Board name
- Specifies if the kernel is a virtual fabric
- Specifies whether the kernel was built in big-endian mode
- Number of memory interfaces (DIMMS or banks) usable as device global memory
   - Global memory start address for interface 0
   - Global memory end address for interface 0
- Size of global memory allocated by program
- Number of kernels
  For each kernel:
   - Kernel name
   - Start address of kernel control registers
   - Size of kernel control registers
   - 0x0 (for internal use)
   - 0x0 (for internal use)
   - 0/1 value to indicate if the kernel is work-group invariant (if the value is 1, kernel launch will be modified to make local_size = global_size. This is an optimization.
   - Number of times kernel operations are vectorized. The kernel will launched with fewer work-items in each work-groups as many times as the number of vector lanes.
   - number of words in this kernel's profile scan chain.
   - Number of kernel arguments
   For each kernel argument:
    - internal # representing its type
    - internal # representing its category
    - its size
   - Number of printf calls
   - Number of local memory systems.
   - X-dim of required work-group size (controlled by __attribute ((reqd_work_group_size(X, Y, Z))) )
   - Y-dim of required work-group size
   - Z-dim of required work-group size
   - Maximum work-group size (controlled by  __attribute((max_work_group_size(M))))
